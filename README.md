# Land Transport and Weather Dashboard

## Overview
The **Land Transport and Weather Dashboard** is a multi-tab dashboard for Singapore that provides near real-time information on selected land transportation and weather information. This app brings together weather, transport, and environmental data in one place, focusing on quick, readable summaries and interactive maps to explore nearby facilities and live conditions.

## Key Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Async API Fetching**: All API calls use `@run_in_thread` decorator with ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel, non-blocking API requests
  - All fetch functions are async-only, using the `run_in_thread` decorator pattern
  - Flood alerts, lightning observations, weather data, and transport data fetched asynchronously
  - Zika and Dengue cluster data fetched asynchronously
  - Parallel coordinate processing for large cluster datasets (>10 features)
  - Consistent async pattern across all API calls for improved responsiveness and scalability

## Requirements

### Python Dependencies

#### Recommended: Using uv Package Manager

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable dependency management. You may refer to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer for the steps in installing uv.

After cloning the repository, set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plotly/Dash-sample-analytics-dashboard-concept.git
cd Dash-sample-analytics-dashboard-concept
uv sync
```

This will create a virtual environment (`.venv`) and install all dependencies. Note that `.venv` is in `.gitignore`, so each user needs to run `uv sync` after cloning.


### Key Dependencies

- **dash**: Web framework for building interactive dashboards
- **dash-leaflet**: Interactive map components
- **plotly**: Data visualization and graphing
- **requests**: HTTP library for API calls
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **pyproj**: Coordinate system transformations (SVY21 to WGS84)
- **pandas**: Data manipulation for carpark locations
- **numpy**: Numerical operations for UV Index graphing
- **concurrent.futures**: ThreadPoolExecutor for async API fetching (via `@run_in_thread` decorator)
- **gunicorn**: WSGI HTTP server for Plotly Cloud deployment

All required packages will be installed, and the app will be able to run.


## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following API keys:

```env
# Data.gov.sg API key (required for weather, PSI, taxi, traffic camera, and health cluster data)

   - Log in to the dashboard, click "Create API Key", and choose between **Developer** (for testing) or **Production** (for operational use) keys
   - **Important**: Copy and store your API key securely - you won't be able to view it again after creation
   - Required for: Weather data, PSI, UV Index, WBGT, taxi availability, traffic cameras, Zika/Dengue clusters

2. **OneMap Credentials**:
   - Register an account at [OneMap Registration](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/register)
   - You will need to provide a username (email) and password during registration
   - After registration, you can generate an API key from your account dashboard
   - **Note**: The application uses your OneMap username (email) and password for authentication with mapbase functionalities
   - Required for: Location search, nearby bus stops, MRT stations, and map tile services

3. **LTA DataMall API Key**:
   - Request API access at [LTA DataMall Request Form](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/request-for-api.html)
   - Fill in the application form with your details and intended usage
   - The API key will be sent to your email after approval
   - Required for: Real-time carpark availability (CarParkAvailabilityv2 API), train service alerts, faulty traffic lights, taxi stands data, and estimated travel times (EstTravelTimes API)

## Using this application

### Local Development

#### Running with uv (Recommended)

After cloning the repository, create a .env file with the following environment variables
```
ONEMAP_EMAIL=<Onemap email>
ONEMAP_EMAIL_PASSWORD=<Onemap password>
DATA_GOV_API=<Data.gov.sg API KEY>
LTA_API_KEY=<Your LTA API KEY>
```
sync dependencies and run the app:

```bash
# Sync dependencies (creates .venv and installs packages)
uv sync

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the app
python app.py

# Or run directly with uv (no activation needed)
uv run app.py
```

**Note**: Since `.venv` is in `.gitignore`, you must run `uv sync` after cloning the repository to create the virtual environment and install dependencies.

Open http://0.0.0.0:8050/ in your browser, you will see an interactive dashboard.

#### Running with pip or Anaconda

If you installed dependencies with pip or Anaconda:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open http://0.0.0.0:8050/ in your browser, you will see an interactive dashboard.
